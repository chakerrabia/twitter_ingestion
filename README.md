# Hashtag Analysis and Visualization

This project aims to collect and analyze real-time tweets based on specific hashtags, perform data processing and sentiment analysis, and visualize the results to gain insights into public sentiment and trends related to the hashtags.

## Project Overview
The project follows the following steps:

- Data Ingestion: Real-time tweets are fetched using the Twitter API or the Tweepy library, based on specific hashtags. A data ingestion pipeline continuously collects tweets and stores them in a database.

- Data Preprocessing: The collected tweets undergo preprocessing to remove irrelevant information like URLs, mentions, and special characters. Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization are applied.

- Sentiment Analysis: A sentiment analysis module assigns sentiment scores to the preprocessed tweets, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral. Libraries such as NLTK, TextBlob, or VADER are commonly used for sentiment analysis.

- Data Storage: The preprocessed tweets, along with their sentiment scores, are stored in a database. The database schema includes fields such as tweet text, sentiment score, timestamp, and user information.

- Visualization: A web-based dashboard is created using a Python web framework like Flask or Django. Visualizations are generated using libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, or D3.js to represent sentiment trends, word clouds, or user engagement. The visualizations are updated dynamically as new tweets arrive and sentiment analysis is performed.

- Schedule and Monitoring: Task scheduling tools such as Cron or Windows Task Scheduler can be used to automate data ingestion and processing tasks. Monitoring and error handling mechanisms are implemented to ensure the pipeline runs smoothly and to capture any potential issues.
